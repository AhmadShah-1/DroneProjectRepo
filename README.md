This program utilizes template matching as part of the detection process, and utilizes pretrained models for Tracking (7 different models can be tested with). 

The problem with this program is that its tailored to a well lit and limited view enviroment, not recommended for a distance under 1 meter and over 4 meters as the 
issue arises with the tracking software. For the most part the template matching is somewhat reliable.
